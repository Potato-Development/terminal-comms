 How to use: 
 Server: 
 Open file and change the host IP and the socket to whatever you choose default is 127.0.0.1 
 note: unsure whether host IP works for public IPs or any IP that is not the local machine 
 If desired, change port on line 4. 5000 seems to work currently 
 Big note: do not change port to a value lower than 1024. Generally, if the port is lower than 1024, the program will NOT run. 
 Client: Change host IP and port to match the server.

***Make sure you run the server is running before you lauch the client. Launching the client before launching the server will not work, and you will have to relaunch the client.***
